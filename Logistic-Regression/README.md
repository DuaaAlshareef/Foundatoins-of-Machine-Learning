# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the logistic function. Despite its simplicity, logistic regression is widely used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing due to its interpretability and efficiency.
