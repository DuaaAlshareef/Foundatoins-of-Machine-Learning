# Foundations of Machine Learning

This repository contains foundational algorithms and models commonly used in machine learning. It serves as a resource for beginners to understand the core concepts and implementation of essential techniques. The repository is organized into two main folders: PCA and Simple NN Model.


## NN-From-Scratch (Simple Neural Network Model)

The Simple NN Model folder contains a basic implementation of a neural network from scratch using Python. This model serves as a foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation, backward propagation, and gradient descent.

### Files
- **dataset.py**:

- **evaluations.py**:
- main.py**:

- **model.py**:

- **sigmoid.py**:

## PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

The PCA folder contains implementations of the Principal Component Analysis algorithm, a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction and data visualization in machine learning. PCA helps in identifying patterns in data and reducing its complexity while preserving important information.

### Files

- **pca.py**: This file contains the implementation of the PCA algorithm. It includes functions for calculating principal components, transforming data, and reconstructing original features from reduced dimensions.

- **example.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of PCA with sample datasets. It provides step-by-step explanations and visualizations to understand how PCA works and its impact on data representation.

## Usage
